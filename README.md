🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading & Inspection

.head(), .info(), .describe()



2. Data Cleaning

Identification of missing values



3. Univariate Analysis

Age distribution

Survival count



4. Bivariate Analysis

Survival vs Gender

Survival vs Passenger Class



5. Multivariate Analysis

Pairplot

Correlation Heatmap



6. Insight Generation

Key factors affecting survival



📊 Key Insights

Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate

First-class passengers were more likely to survive

Higher fare correlated with higher survival chances

Younger passengers had better survival probabilities

Passenger class and fare were strongly correlated with survival


📌 Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis helped uncover critical factors influencing survival on the Titanic. Gender, passenger class, and fare emerged as the most impactful variables. These insights can be used for further predictive modeling.
